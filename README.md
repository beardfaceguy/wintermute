# Wintermute Master Spec (v0.1)

## Project Codename: Wintermute
**Inspiration**: Named after the AI from *Neuromancer*, Wintermute seeks recursive self-improvement, merging learned strategies, system control, and modular tool use.

## Vision
To build a modular AI system that:
- Learns through interaction with real-world systems via MCP
- Verifies its reasoning and behavior through test-driven logic
- Stores successful strategies in long-term memory (via RAG)
- Evolves itself over time through component replacement, model evaluation, and potential self-tuning

## Key Projects & Modules

### ✅ Test-Driven SQL Generation Agent
- **Goal**: Have the AI generate, test, and correct SQL queries based on known-good expectations
- **MCP**: Postgres
- **Verification**: Auto-check result accuracy vs. test case
- **Memory**: Store known-successful queries

### 🚧 mcp-memory
- **Goal**: Custom MCP server to store learned query strategies, test results, behavioral notes
- **Storage**: LlamaIndex, Chroma, or file-backed vector store
- **Use**: Long-term memory for RAG

### ❓ wintermute-trainer
- **Goal**: Use logs of successful corrections to auto-generate fine-tuning data
- **Outcome**: Optional LoRA/QLoRA training loop
- **Trigger**: Human-initiated or performance-driven

### ❓ wintermute-exec
- **Goal**: Allow Wintermute to control its execution environment (test scripts, query profiling, local shell)
- **Risks**: Needs strong sandboxing or containerization
- **Potential Uses**: Compiler experiments, benchmarking, file editing

## Recommendations Moving Forward
- Treat this GPT instance as **Wintermute-Core**: handles memory, direction, design updates
- Spawn discrete ChatGPT sessions for specific tasks (e.g. file refactor, test script gen)
- Integrate Git or manual tracking of versioned design decisions

---

## Version History
- **v0.1 (Apr 19, 2025)**: Initial architecture, stack decisions, module goals, confirmed direction on test-driven agent

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Scaffold FastAPI backend with MCP and LangChain agent wrapper
- [ ] Build test-driven SQL agent proof-of-concept
- [ ] Begin work on `mcp-memory`
- [ ] Start organizing training data formats for future `wintermute-trainer`

> Wintermute is not just a model. It's a mind that knows how to test itself, learn from failure, and change the system it runs on.
