# Cursor Agent Guidelines

## For Cursor Agents

This project uses a comprehensive `.cursor/` directory system to maintain consistent AI assistant behavior and project context. **All Cursor Agents working on this project MUST follow the rules and guidelines defined in the `.cursor/` directory.**

## .cursor Directory Overview

The `.cursor/` directory serves as a comprehensive knowledge base and rule system for AI-assisted development on the Alix Estate Manager project. It contains:

### 📁 **rules/** - AI Assistant Behavior Rules
- **12 specialized rule files** governing different aspects of AI behavior
- **MANDATORY COMPLIANCE** - these rules MUST be followed and kept in context
- Covers command execution, memory management, package manager consistency, code quality validation, minimal changes principle, deprecated code alerts, AI response boundaries, and safety protocols
- **CRITICAL**: Always keep `.cursor/rules/` directory contents in context for every session

### 📁 **memory/** - Cross-Cutting Insights  
- **`memory.md`** - Comprehensive cross-cutting insights and reusable knowledge (422 lines)
- **Updated when discovering** architecture patterns, environment gotchas, or lessons learned
- Maintains valuable knowledge across multiple implementations and sessions
- Contains detailed environment configurations, authentication info, and critical commands

### 📁 **docs/** - Project Documentation
- **Implementation plans** - Detailed implementation plans for specific tasks organized by Jira ticket (e.g., AE-1222/)
- **Setup guides** - Environment setup and dependency resolution guides
- **Discovery Agent Analysis** - Comprehensive analysis of AI-powered document processing system
- **CodeRabbit Rules Reference** - Detailed coding standards and compliance rules
- **ALIX Coding Practices** - Best practices derived from PR reviews
- **research_repos/** - Reference snapshots of related repositories (alix-api, alix-estate-manager) for research and context

### 📁 **patches/** - Backup and Recovery
- Currently empty directory for storing code patches and rollback capabilities

## Critical Rules for Cursor Agents

### 🚨 **MANDATORY RULES**
1. **Memory Tracking**: Update `.cursor/memory/memory.md` with cross-cutting insights and reusable knowledge
2. **Implementation Tracking**: Update both memory.md and implementation files together
3. **Command Safety**: Never use unescaped `!` in shell commands
4. **Interactive Commands**: Use non-interactive flags (`--no-pager`, `| cat`, etc.)
5. **Package Manager Consistency**: ALWAYS use yarn, NEVER use npm
6. **Pre-Commit Validation**: ALWAYS run `yarn typecheck` and `yarn lint` before every commit
7. **Requirement Clarification**: NEVER assume requirements or add "common practices" without explicit user approval
8. **Minimal Changes Principle**: ALWAYS GO FOR THE MINIMUM CHANGES NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE TASK - Never make architectural changes that affect many components without explicit approval
9. **Deprecated Code Alert**: ALWAYS ALERT WHEN WORKING WITH DEPRECATED CODE - Stop and ask for team discussion or explicit approval before modifying deprecated code
10. **AI Response Boundaries**: Clearly distinguish between capabilities and actions in AI responses
11. **Git Review Tagging**: Use appropriate git tags for review milestone tracking
12. **SSM Command Completion**: Do not call `shutdown` inside SSM training/eval commands; stop/terminate separately after SSM completes (add brief sleep if shutdown is unavoidable)

### 📋 **Project Status**
- Check `.cursor/memory/memory.md` for cross-cutting insights and patterns
- Review `.cursor/docs/` for specific implementation plans
- Follow established patterns documented in the implementation files

## Quick Start for New Agents

1. **🚨 CRITICAL**: Always keep `.cursor/rules/` directory contents in context for every session
2. **Read the rules**: Start with `.cursor/rules/README.md` for complete rule overview
3. **Check memory**: Review `.cursor/memory/memory.md` for cross-cutting insights and patterns
4. **Review implementation**: Read relevant files in `.cursor/docs/` for detailed plans
5. **Follow patterns**: Use established implementation patterns from documentation
6. **Update memory**: Add cross-cutting insights to `.cursor/memory/memory.md` when discovered
